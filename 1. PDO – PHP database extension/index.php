    // 1. PDO â€“ PHP database extension
    /*
        PDO (PHP Data Objects) is a PP extension through which we can access and work with databases. Through PDO is similar in many aspects to mySQLi, it is better to workwith for the following reasons:
            - It's better protected against hackers;
            - It's consistent across databases, so it can work with MySQL as well as other types of databases (SQLite, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.);
            - It's object oriented as it's core.
